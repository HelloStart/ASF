<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
	We target to fix all bugs reported as fast as possible. To ensure that
	you can determine if there are bugs related to the code you have
	decided to use you can visit our bug tracking tool.
</p>
<p>
	Here you can report both bugs you find and enhancements that you would
	like to see. You will also be able to vote on enhancements already in
	reported to put them higher on our priority list: ASF is for the users
	and we need your input to know what you want us to add.
</p>
<p>
	Also you will be able to see what fixes we have planned for
	in our next release.

<h2>How to report a bug/enhancement?</h2>
<p>
	Some bugs might have already been fixed before you report it. So you
	might want to search for the related entries first before reporting an
	issue or an enhancement.
</p>
<br />
<p>
	1. The best way is to search for the module related to the bug/enhancement
	you intent to report. Use the search field on top of this page to
	locate the module.
</p>
<br />
<p>
	2. Select the appropriate entry in the dynamic table of the search page.
	Look in the "Bugs / enhancements list" section if there are related
	reports. Note: if this section does not show up, it means that no
	known bugs or enhancements are related to this module.
</p>
<br />
<p>
	3. If you cannot find a related report for this module, click on the
	appropriate link from the "Links" section to report the bug or
	enhancement. This process will pre-fill the report with related
	information to help us locate the misbehaving module.
