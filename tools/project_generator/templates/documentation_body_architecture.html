<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	The intention of ASF is to provide a rich set of proven drivers and code
	modules developed by Atmel experts to reduce customer design-time. It
	simplifies the usage of microcontrollers, providing an abstraction to
	the hardware and high-value middlewares.
</p>
<p>
	ASF is a free and open-source code library designed to be used for
	evaluation, prototyping, design and production phases.

<p>
	ASF consists of source code modules and applications demonstrating the
	use of these.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li><p><a href="asf_drivers.html">Drivers</a> is composed of a driver.c
		and driver.h file that provides low level register interface
		functions to access a peripheral or device specific feature. The
		services and components will interface the drivers.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><a href="asf_services.html">Services</a> is a module type which
		provides more application oriented software such as a USB
		classes, FAT file system, architecture optimized DSP library,
		graphical library, etc.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><a href="asf_components.html">Components</a> is a module type
		which provides software drivers to access external hardware
		components such as memory (e.g. Atmel DataFlash&reg;, SDRAM,
		SRAM, and NAND flash), displays, sensors, wireless, etc.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><a href="asf_boards.html">Boards</a> contains mapping of all
		digital and analog peripheral to each I/O pin of Atmel's
		development kits.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	The documentation is offered as HTML (these pages). The documentation
	is generated using Doxygen, and all the Doxygen tags/comments are
	therefore in the source code, also to make it possible for you to reuse
	this documentation in your own project if desired.
</p>
<br />
<p>
	ASF is currently oriented towards Atmel Studio
	<a href="http://www.atmel.com/atmelstudio">www.atmel.com/atmelstudio</a>,
	since it contains so much code that it can be hard to navigate in it
	manually. Atmel Studio is offering a helping hand through the use
	of wizards, filters and documentation.
</p>
<br />
<p>
	For those of you who do not want to use Atmel Studio, you can
	download and use ASF as a stand-alone package, see the
	<a href="download.html">download</a> page. Note that ASF also supports
	IAR and have IAR project files for all projects.
