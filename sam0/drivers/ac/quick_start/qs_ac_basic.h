/**
 * \page ac_basic_use_case Quick Start Guide for the Analog Comparator module - Basic Use Case
 *
 * In this use case, the Analog Comparator module is configured for:
 *  \li Comparator peripheral in manually triggered (i.e. "One Shot" mode)
 *  \li One comparator channel connected to input MUX pin 0
 *  \li Comp
 *
 * This use case sets up the Analog Comparator to TODO.

 * \section ac_basic_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection ac_basic_use_case_setup_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no special setup requirements for this use-case.
 *
 * \subsection ac_basic_use_case_setup_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_ac_basic.c setup
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_ac_basic.c setup_init
