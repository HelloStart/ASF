 *
 * This driver for SAM devices provides an interface for the configuration
 * and management of the device's system relation functionality, necessary for
 * the basic device operation. This is not limited to a single peripheral, but
 * extends across multiple hardware peripherals,
 *
 * The following peripherals are used by this module:
 * \if DEVICE_SAML21_SUPPORT
 *	- PM (Power Manager)
 *  - RSTC(Reset Controller)
 *  - SUPC(Supply Controller)
 *	\else
 * - SYSCTRL (System Control)
 * - PM (Power Manager)
 * \endif 
 *
 * The following devices can use this module:
 *  - SAM D20/D21
 *  - SAM R21
 *  - SAM D10/D11
 *  - SAM L21
 *
 * The outline of this documentation is as follows:

 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_special_considerations

 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_system_prerequisites Prerequisites
 *
 * There are no prerequisites for this module.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview Module Overview
 *
 * The System driver provides a collection of interfaces between the user
 * application logic, and the core device functionality (such as clocks, reset
 * cause determination, etc.) that is required for all applications. It contains
 * a number of sub-modules that control one specific aspect of the device:
 *
 * - System Core (this module)
 * - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_clock_group "System Clock Control" (sub-module)
 * - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_interrupt_group "System Interrupt Control" (sub-module)
 * - \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_pinmux_group "System Pin Multiplexer Control" (sub-module)
 *
 *
 * \if DEVICE_SAML21_SUPPORT
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_vreg Voltage Regulator
 * The SAML21 device controls the voltage regulators for the core (VDDCORE) and
 * backup (VDDBU) domains. It sets the voltage regulators according to the sleep modes, 
 * the performance level, or the user configuration. 
 *
 * In active mode, the voltage regulator can be chosen on the fly between a LDO or a 
 * Buck converter.In standby mode, the low power voltage regulator is used to supply 
 * VDDCORE.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_bbps Battery Backup Power Switch
 * The SAML21 device supports connection of a battery backup to the VBAT power pin. 
 * It includes functionality that enables automatic power switching between main power 
 * and battery backup power. This will ensure power to the backup domain, when the main 
 * battery or power source is unavailable.
 * \endif 
 * 
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_vref Voltage References
 * The various analog modules within the SAM devices (such as AC, ADC and
 * DAC) require a voltage reference to be configured to act as a reference point
 * for comparisons and conversions.
 *
 * The SAM devices contain multiple references, including an internal
 * temperature sensor, and a fixed band-gap voltage source. When enabled, the
 * associated voltage reference can be selected within the desired peripheral
 * where applicable.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_reset_cause System Reset Cause
 * In some application there may be a need to execute a different program
 * flow based on how the device was reset. For example, if the cause of reset
 * was the Watchdog timer (WDT), this might indicate an error in the application
 * and a form of error handling or error logging might be needed.
 *
 * For this reason, an API is provided to retrieve the cause of the last system
 * reset, so that appropriate action can be taken.
 *
 * \if DEVICE_SAML21_SUPPORT
 * For SAM L21,There are three groups of reset sources:
 *
 * Power supply reset: Resets caused by an electrical issue. It covers POR and BODs reset.
 *
 * User reset: Resets caused by the application. It covers external reset, system reset 
 * request and watchdog reset.
 *
 * Backup reset: Resets caused by a backup mode exit condition.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_performance_level Performance Level
 * Performance level allows use to adjust the regulator output voltage to reduce power consumption. 
 * The user can select on the fly the performance level configuration which best suits its application.
 *
 * The SAM L21 device embeds up to three performance level (PL0, PL1 and PL2).Each performance level
 * defines a maximum frequency and a corresponding consumption in Î¼A/MHz,when the application selects a new
 * performance level, the voltage applied on the full logic area moves from a value to another, it can reduce
 * the active consumption while decreasing the maximum frequency of the device 
 *
 * Performance level transition is possible only when the device is in active mode,after a reset, the device starts
 * in the lowest performance level (lowest power consumption and lowest max frequency). The application can then 
 * switch to another performance level at anytime without any stop in the code execution. As shown in
 * \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_performance_level_transition_figure 
 *
 * \anchor asfdoc_sam0_system_performance_level_transition_figure
 * \image html performance_level_transition.gif "The performance level  transition"
 
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_system_module_overview_power_domain Power Domain
 * Power domain gating  can  turn on or off power domain voltage to save power while keeping other
 * domain powered up. It can be used in standby sleep mode,in standby mode, when power-gated, the internal
 * state of the logic can be retained  allowing the application context to be kept.
 *
 * The SAM L21 device has five power domains.
 *
 * Switchable power domains (PD0, PD1 and PD2): these power domains uses the power domain gating
 * technique and can then be set to either active, retention or off state. 
 *
 * Always-on power domain(PDTOP): this power domain is either in active or off state
 *
 * Backup power domain(PDBACKUP): this power domain is always in active state (except in off sleep mode).
 * There are four cases to consider in standby mode:
 *
 * Case 1:PD0, PD1 and PD2  are running.
 *
 * Case 2:PD0 and PD1  are running while PD2 is in retention.
 *
 * Case 3:PD0 is running while PD1 and PD2 are in retention state.
 *
 * Case 4:PD0, PD1 and PD2  are in retention state
 *
 * Here is an overview of sleep mode versus power domain state.As shown in
 * \ref asfdoc_sam0_system_power_domain_overview_table

 * To enter device sleep, one of the available sleep modes must be set, and the
 * function to enter sleep called. The device will automatically wake up in
 * response to an interrupt being generated or other device event.
 *
 * Some peripheral clocks will remain enabled during sleep, depending on their
 * configuration; if desired, modules can remain clocked during sleep to allow
 * them to continue to operate while other parts of the system are powered down
 * to save power.
