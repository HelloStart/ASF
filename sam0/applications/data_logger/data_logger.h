 * This application demonstrates a data logger. The environment temperature is
 * read using 103 AP-2 thermistor from Semitec.
 * The readings are then stored in the serial flash AT25FD081A on the
 * SAM D21 Xplained Pro. The user can access the logs via serial port.

 * \section appdoc_sam0_datalogger_intro Introduction
 * Data logger, as its name indicates measures the given input periodically
 * and stores them in a non-volatile media. In this application, the RTC inside
 * SAM D21 is configured to trigger ADC conversions at regular intervals.
 * This application also demonstrates the use of Direct Memory Access
 * Controller (DMAC).
 * 
 * The DMAC when used with Event System or peripheral triggers, provides a
 * considerable advantage by reducing the power consumption and performing
 * data transfer in the background.
 * SAM D21 devices with DMAC enables high data transfer rates with minimum
 * CPU intervention and frees up CPU time. With access to all peripherals,
 * the DMAC can handle automatic transfer of data to/from modules.
 * It supports static and incremental addressing for both source and
 * destination.
 *
 * \section appdoc_sam0_datalogger_setup Hardware Setup
 * Connect the thermistor as shown in
 * \ref appdoc_sam0_datalogger_thermistor_conn "the diagram below"
 *
 * \anchor appdoc_sam0_datalogger_thermistor_conn
 *
 * \image html therm_conn.svg "Thermistor connection"
 *
 * \section appdoc_sam0_datalogger_usage Usage
 *
 * This application uses an NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistor,
 * whose resistance decreases as temperature increases.
 * For the thermistor used in this application, the Steinhartâ€“Hart
 * coefficients are found using three reference points as shown below.
 * The 'Temperature Vs Resistance' characteristics of the thermistor
 * can be obtained from the manufacturer.
 *
 *   <table border="0" cellborder="1" cellspacing="0" >
 *    <tr>
 *        <th> Temperature (Deg C) </th> <th> Resistance of the Thermistor  (Ohms)</th>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *     <td > 0 </td>
 *     <td > 27250 </td>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *     <td > 25 </td>
 *     <td > 10000 </td>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *     <td > 50 </td>
 *     <td > 4162 </td>
 *    </tr>
 *   </table>
 * 
 * The Steinhart-Hart equation is used to find temperature in degrees Kelvin.
 *
 * 1/T = A + B ln(R) + C (ln(R))^3
 *
 * The coefficients are defined in the code as below
 *
\code{.cpp}
 #define SHH_COEFF_A 0.0008913055475
 #define SHH_COEFF_B 0.0002507779917
 #define SHH_COEFF_C 0.0000001957724056
\endcode
 *
 * 
 * As shown in hardware setup, a voltage divider is made using the
 * thermistor and a 10 k Ohm series resistor. When the room temperature is
 * 25 Deg C, the thermistor resistance is 10 k Ohm and the ADC input voltage
 * will be close to VCC/2. 
 * This voltage has dependency on the tolerance of the series
 * resistor.
 *
 * Reference for the ADC is chosen as VCC/1.48.
 * By using oversampling and decimation, the ADC resolution is increased from
 * 12 bits to 16 bits. To increase the resolution by n bits, 4^n samples must
 * be accumulated. The result must then be shifted right by n bits.
 * In this example the ADC is configured for averaging mode and the number
 * of samples accumulated is chosen as 256. In this case, the number of
 * automatic right shifts will be four, which results in 16-bit resolution.
 * More details on the ADC configuration is available in the device datasheet.
 *
 * The CPU is kept in Idle sleep and the RTC time-out event triggers ADC
 * conversion. The DMAC module is used for data transfer from the ADC result
 * register into an array in SRAM. Once a predefined number of conversions
 * are done, the data is transferred into the Serial Flash for non-volatile
 * storage.
 *
 * When a read request is received via the serial port, the logs are read from
 * the serial flash and send through the serial port.
 * This SRAM to USART data transfer also makes use of the DMAC.
 * SERCOM3 is configured as USART, through which the user can read the logs.
 * This is the same port used as virtual COM port, by the Embedded debugger
 * on the SAM D21 Xplained Pro.
 *
 * \section appdoc_sam0_datalogger_compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for ARM.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
